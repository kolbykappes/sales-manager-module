# Sales Manager Project Coding Guidelines

Welcome to the Sales Manager Project Coding Guidelines. To maintain a well-organized and consistent codebase, we have divided our guidelines into three main categories:

1. [General Guidelines](general_guidelines.md)
2. [Backend Guidelines](backend_guidelines.md)
3. [Frontend Guidelines](frontend_guidelines.md)

Please refer to these specific files for detailed guidelines in each area of development.

## Development Environment

This project is developed on a Windows environment. When providing commands or scripts, please ensure they are compatible with Windows systems. For example, use Windows command prompt or PowerShell syntax instead of Unix-like commands.

Remember to balance between code quality, performance, and development speed when making implementation decisions. Regularly review and update these guidelines as the project evolves.
