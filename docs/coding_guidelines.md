# Sales Manager Project Coding Guidelines

Welcome to the Sales Manager Project Coding Guidelines. To maintain a well-organized and consistent codebase, we have divided our guidelines into three main categories:

1. [General Guidelines](general_guidelines.md)
2. [Backend Guidelines](backend_guidelines.md)
3. [Frontend Guidelines](frontend_guidelines.md)

Please refer to these specific files for detailed guidelines in each area of development.

Remember to balance between code quality, performance, and development speed when making implementation decisions. Regularly review and update these guidelines as the project evolves.
