# General Coding Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

## Documentation
- Write docstrings for classes and functions.
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation.
- Document complex business logic and important architectural decisions.
- Use clear and concise comments for non-obvious code sections.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Implement error handling and logging throughout the application.

## Type Hinting
- Use type hints in function signatures and variable declarations.

## Configuration
- Use the `config.py` file with the `Settings` class (based on Pydantic's BaseSettings) for application configuration.
- Utilize environment variables for sensitive information and deployment-specific settings.
- Use a .env file for local development and ensure it's not committed to version control.
- Access configuration values through the `settings` instance imported from `config.py`.

## Security
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- Use HTTPS for all communications in production.

## Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Create feature branches for new developments.
- Perform code reviews before merging into the main branch.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for backend logic and API endpoints.
- Implement integration tests for critical workflows.
- Use mock objects for external dependencies in tests.
